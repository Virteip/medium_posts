"description": " <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZjoVjtoZjytnyuCTcukNQ.jpeg"><figcaption>Little Billy managing a cluster of servers using SSH. Look how focused he is.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to handle remote servers or maybe you just want to set up a connection to your local computer this is your spot. If you keep reading you will know enough about SSH to establish a secure connection to a remote machine.</p> <p>This can be useful for your home computer in case you forgot something while you’re away and need to connect to it to retrieve it.</p> <p>I will show you in a few steps how to set up an SSH connection through your terminal. The process is quite simple but first let me set YOU up with the basics.</p> <p>What you need:</p> <ul> <li>Your favorite Shell.</li> <li>Make sure you have SSH installed, it comes by default on Linux and MacOS systems. If not just run the following commands:</li> </ul> <blockquote>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</blockquote> <blockquote>sudo systemctl enable ssh</blockquote> <blockquote>sudo systemctl start ssh</blockquote> <h3>What is SSH?</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*aBH2tGLhouFtEW26qLrfEQ.png"></figure><p>Simply put, Secure Shell is a protocol designed to transfer data between a client and a server (two computers basically) over an untrusted network.</p> <p>The way SSH works is it encrypts the connection using a pair of keys and the server, which is the computer you would connect to, is usually waiting for an SSH connection on Port 22.</p> <p>Now let’s see how to create the key pair and then connect:</p> <h3>How to create an SSH-key pair:</h3> <p>1) Type ssh-keygen -t rsa in your shell. This command will create the keys with the rsa version 2 protocol (recommended).</p> <p>2) You will be asked for a location. If you decide to enter one manually then that will be the pair’s location, if you leave the default one it will be inside the .ssh hidden folder in your home directory.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/721/1*ezGECU1V2UshKHzw0Nq8ig.png"></figure><p>3) Now you will be prompted for a password. If you enter one you will be asked for it every time you use the key, this works for added security. If you don’t want a password just press enter and continue without one.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/663/1*CRzuZ9UyjJ5cVA-Nv1SIyQ.png"></figure><p>4) There is no 4! That’s it! Your keys have been saved in the specified folder and you will see something weird like this:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*qKBeHM9Vp6ESDRbnVhyTnA.png"></figure><p>As you may have noticed from the image in point #3 two files were created. One file ends with the ‘.pub’ extension and the other one doesn’t.</p> <p><strong>The file that ends with ‘.pub’ is your public key.</strong> <strong>This key needs to be in the computer you want to connect to (the server) inside a file called </strong><strong>authorized_keys</strong> . You can accomplish this with the following command:</p> <p>ssh-copy-id username@ip</p> <p>For example in my case to send the key to my computer it would be:</p> <p>ssh-copy-id sergiop@132.132.132.132</p> <p>If you have MacOS there’s a chance you don’t have ssh-copy-id installed, in that case you can install it using brew install ssh-copy-id.</p> <p><strong>The file that has no extension is your private key. You must cherish it, save it, take care of it. There is only one and you can’t generate another one if you lose it so I recommend you send it to your email or something like that.</strong></p> <p>Remember both keys have the same name the only difference is one ends with ‘.pub’ and the other one doesn’t.</p> <h3>How to connect to a remote machine using SSH:</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*-8suaPYFJBlGo7t6K4yM2Q.png"><figcaption>Transferring to the remote server using ssh.</figcaption></figure><p>For this final trick I would like you to use the following command:</p> <p>ssh -i ~/private/key/location remote_username@remote_ip</p> <p>This command uses the -i flag for you to specify where the private key is located. Remember where it is? Now type its location there. Where it says username type the one you are going to connect as and then type the remote machine’s ip address after the ‘@’ symbol. Just like we did earlier to transfer the key.</p> <p>You will be asked if you’re sure you want to continue connecting since the ‘authenticity of host can’t be established’. Type ‘yes’ and hit Enter. This is just because this is your first time connecting to that machine.</p> <p>Now you will be asked to enter a password if you set one with the key or if the user you’re connecting to has one set up.</p> <p>Once you successfully do it you will see something like this:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/669/1*0-Nvr9Ib_tSef4jrQzzGig.png"></figure><ul><li> <strong>Note:</strong> it doesn’t have to look exactly like this; your configuration and specs will vary.

"description": " <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DxqX_qq57qBYCsEzvv72WQ.jpeg"></figure><p>There is no shortcut and no magic tricks.</p> <p>The only way around is through and this might help you in the long run. No, it is not easy but neither is programming and you’re already doing that!</p> <h3>1) WORKOUT/SPORTS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Imt0vB0yEc5Ib4SPogY7-w.jpeg"><figcaption>mountain bike</figcaption></figure><p>As obvious as this might seem it has to be mentioned.</p> <p>When it comes to physical activity we are not well known for being the most athletic kind of people. This is a direct consequence of spending countless hours sitting in front of the computer, carelessly eating some snacks to keep working. Taking breaks is important but being active in them is also important!</p> <p>Let me reassure you that after a hard coding session what you need the most is distraction. When you are pushing your limits both physically and mentally you are creating balance and letting off steam.</p> <p>Working out (in any way you like) can help you reduce stress and anxiety, improve your state of mind, improve your confidence and keep you healthy in your everyday life!</p> <h3>2) COUNT CALORIES (IIFYM)</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7O4bbLjcRljNlddon33Pgg.png"><figcaption>You can eat pizza on IIFYM</figcaption></figure><p>Losing weight and/or gaining weight has a lot of factors that go around it but for the most part it’s a game of calories in — calories out and fitting the rest of your macro-nutrients in your daily caloric intake.</p> <p>There is a great method, I don’t like to call it a diet since people associate them with starving themselves, called I.I.F.Y.M (If It Fits Your Macros). This is based on the science that each person has a certain nutrient intake every day that they can manipulate it to maintain, lose, or gain weight.</p> <p>The way this method works is simple: you have your macro-nutrient quota and it’s up to you how you spend it. You can eat a McDonalds burger or an icecream with absolutely no guilt if it fits your macros ;)</p> <p>Count your daily intake by using an app called MyFitness Pal (available on all platforms). Do this a couple of days and see what you average. Then, depending on the objective you have start controlling your caloric and nutrient intake (the app gives you all that info). If for example you want to lose weight start a caloric deficit (start with around 300 calories less) and see how it goes for a week.</p> <p>This is the best way to control your weight that I know of, it’s kind of tedious to be entering your meal info on the app daily but it’s also worth it!</p> <h3>3) GOOD POSTURE</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*kAJTiykBHk_oy6BvDa0UDA.png"></figure><p>We’re told time and time again to sit up straight, and it’s annoying! But it’s all for good reasons. Bad posture can affect your health in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>A bad posture while in front of the computer can give you back, neck and shoulder pain. It can also cause poor circulation giving you varicose veins, cause poor digestion by compressing your abdominal organs, misaligned spine and other nasty things.</p> <p>It is very important for you to do your best and be conscious of the way you sit down. This will help you correct your posture when you catch yourself slouching too much, you don’t want to end up like her:</p> <figure><img alt="Image from: https://news.sky.com/story/life-sized-model-shows-what-office-workers-might-look-like-in-20-years-11843868" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Rs1cWwsbRWaKHVXWtmdLDg.png"></figure><p>Her name is Emma and she is a representation scientists have made of how a middle aged woman with all sorts of health issues (derived from a desk job in front of a computer) would look like.</p> <p>With the three things I mentioned above you can avoid many of the things afflicting Emma like that horrible hunch or the swollen wrists due to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p> <h3>4) TAKE BREAKS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HlJaUWMvqme6OKDeecxLug.png"></figure><p>Life is all about perspectives, the way you see the world shapes it for you.</p> <p>After spending countless hours coding and trying to fix a bug your vision can become blurry, your eyes are tired from looking at the screen and your head feels like it’s about to blow. Somehow you still can’t let this go. This is personal now.

"content": " <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DxqX_qq57qBYCsEzvv72WQ.jpeg"></figure><p>There is no shortcut and no magic tricks.</p> <p>The only way around is through and this might help you in the long run. No, it is not easy but neither is programming and you’re already doing that!</p> <h3>1) WORKOUT/SPORTS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Imt0vB0yEc5Ib4SPogY7-w.jpeg"><figcaption>mountain bike</figcaption></figure><p>As obvious as this might seem it has to be mentioned.</p> <p>When it comes to physical activity we are not well known for being the most athletic kind of people. This is a direct consequence of spending countless hours sitting in front of the computer, carelessly eating some snacks to keep working. Taking breaks is important but being active in them is also important!</p> <p>Let me reassure you that after a hard coding session what you need the most is distraction. When you are pushing your limits both physically and mentally you are creating balance and letting off steam.</p> <p>Working out (in any way you like) can help you reduce stress and anxiety, improve your state of mind, improve your confidence and keep you healthy in your everyday life!</p> <h3>2) COUNT CALORIES (IIFYM)</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7O4bbLjcRljNlddon33Pgg.png"><figcaption>You can eat pizza on IIFYM</figcaption></figure><p>Losing weight and/or gaining weight has a lot of factors that go around it but for the most part it’s a game of calories in — calories out and fitting the rest of your macro-nutrients in your daily caloric intake.</p> <p>There is a great method, I don’t like to call it a diet since people associate them with starving themselves, called I.I.F.Y.M (If It Fits Your Macros). This is based on the science that each person has a certain nutrient intake every day that they can manipulate it to maintain, lose, or gain weight.</p> <p>The way this method works is simple: you have your macro-nutrient quota and it’s up to you how you spend it. You can eat a McDonalds burger or an icecream with absolutely no guilt if it fits your macros ;)</p> <p>Count your daily intake by using an app called MyFitness Pal (available on all platforms). Do this a couple of days and see what you average. Then, depending on the objective you have start controlling your caloric and nutrient intake (the app gives you all that info). If for example you want to lose weight start a caloric deficit (start with around 300 calories less) and see how it goes for a week.</p> <p>This is the best way to control your weight that I know of, it’s kind of tedious to be entering your meal info on the app daily but it’s also worth it!</p> <h3>3) GOOD POSTURE</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*kAJTiykBHk_oy6BvDa0UDA.png"></figure><p>We’re told time and time again to sit up straight, and it’s annoying! But it’s all for good reasons. Bad posture can affect your health in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>A bad posture while in front of the computer can give you back, neck and shoulder pain. It can also cause poor circulation giving you varicose veins, cause poor digestion by compressing your abdominal organs, misaligned spine and other nasty things.</p> <p>It is very important for you to do your best and be conscious of the way you sit down. This will help you correct your posture when you catch yourself slouching too much, you don’t want to end up like her:</p> <figure><img alt="Image from: https://news.sky.com/story/life-sized-model-shows-what-office-workers-might-look-like-in-20-years-11843868" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Rs1cWwsbRWaKHVXWtmdLDg.png"></figure><p>Her name is Emma and she is a representation scientists have made of how a middle aged woman with all sorts of health issues (derived from a desk job in front of a computer) would look like.</p> <p>With the three things I mentioned above you can avoid many of the things afflicting Emma like that horrible hunch or the swollen wrists due to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p> <h3>4) TAKE BREAKS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HlJaUWMvqme6OKDeecxLug.png"></figure><p>Life is all about perspectives, the way you see the world shapes it for you.</p> <p>After spending countless hours coding and trying to fix a bug your vision can become blurry, your eyes are tired from looking at the screen and your head feels like it’s about to blow. Somehow you still can’t let this go. This is personal now. The bug must be hunted down.</p> <p>Then comes a team mate just chilling, sipping a nice hot coffee he just made for himself, and asks you “What’s wrong?” so you tell him and after looking at your screen for two seconds he tells you you have an extra bracket at the end of your code. You feel stupid now, how could that happen?</p> <p>Perspective! You need to take breaks, this is fundamental in your life.

"description": " <h3>How To Build A Blog Website Fast And Easy</h3> <figure><img alt="Fierce Lego Lady ready to build her website in this quarantine." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GpWp4yalWV9yQiuvRWHnLw.jpeg"></figure><p>So you want to start to have some online presence and you need a website as soon as possible? This guide will fit your needs perfectly as I will show you how to easily build and deploy a site without any large quantities of money or anything like that. Get ready to build something this quarantine like this fierce lego lady is.</p> <p>This guide is meant for people with little knowledge on web dynamics to provide the steps needed to have a successful up-and-running site in no time. I will teach you where to get the template (because there is no need to reinvent the wheel), how to customize it, how the custom domains work, and finally how to upload your project to the web for the world to see. Take into account that there are a myriad of different alternatives different than the ones I’m going to show you here, each with its pros and cons, but this is just the starting point for you to begin your web journey and get the hype up.</p> <p>First of all, you might be wondering what do I mean by a “static site”. A static site is just a website whose content doesn’t change often and is mainly just up for informational purposes. An example of this would be something like a portfolio site that doesn’t get updated so often or a law firm’s site that just displays information on their services and some other general data, maybe a contact form.</p> <p>Now let’s got straight to the point:</p> <h3>STEP I: create a GitHub account.</h3> <p>GitHub is basically a social network for developers (like Behance is for creatives and artists to display their work). It is very easy to use and we will need this later on in order to host our source code.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/">Click here to go to the website.</a></p> <p>Github is a social network that uses the Git version control system. This means that basically you can save an article that you wrote here, then update the file because you forgot to add something but oh it turns out the way it was before was actually better! Don’t worry in this case thanks to the version control you will be able to go back to a previous version where everything was good, like time travel.</p> <p>Learning how to properly use Git will do wonders for you and save you a lot of headaches once you start getting deeper into programming but for now we’ll just use it to link the account to Netlify’s service.</p> <h3>STEP II: create a Netlify account.</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w27eVyuKccjhaX94B8l2FA.png"><figcaption>Netlify front page</figcaption></figure><p>Netlify is a modern platform designed to help you host your sites easier. This helps you save money in unnecessary hosting services if you just want to build a static site and not something that requires a massive backend development like a social network.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/">Click here to go to the website.</a></p> <p>Go to the link I just provided and click on ‘Get Started For Free’. Now you will be asked to log-in with a service of your choice, you will be given several options but guess which one you need to choose. That’s right, Github. After you selected it the system will prompt you to authorize Netlify -some backend magic happens here with OAuth security methods- and finally your account will be set.</p> <figure><img alt="Github Authentication screen" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G7J8sG45zUA9kEBUn3m-sg.png"></figure><p>Yes, it’s that simple, github will facilitate your life in many ways.</p> <h3>STEP III: Downoad Publii CMS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c1nbe03bdy5bq9Txz_extg.png"><figcaption>Publii main screen</figcaption></figure><p>A Control Management System or better known as a CMS is a software that will allow you to build and edit web pages in this case with little to no technical knowledge. There are many other use cases and many different types of CMS tools for all sorts of thing but in this case we will keep our eyes on the web development side and use a CMS called ‘Publii’.</p> <p>Publii is an open source CMS developed by a guy named Bob Mitro that has been around in the web development world for a while now. This is not his first rodeo and it shows.</p> <p>Publii is designed to be used from your desktop so you have the advantage of being able to test your modifications offline, it will give you very fast loading speeds due to the lack of unnecessary bloating in the websites and it is a perfect start for your blogging journey.</p> <p>Now, you might be thinking: why would I use this instead of Wordpress? While Wordpress is the most widely used CMS in the market and it has a million features the reality is you need to spend more money, have greater technical knowledge, it is harder to handle and unless you want a very big website with lots of dynamic functions that require the use of some specific plugins it is not necessary. So let’s get started with the beautiful Publii!</p> <p><a href="https://getpublii.com/download/">First go to this site.</a></p> <p>Here you will be presented with some options for the type of download you want. Select the one that corresponds to your operating system and execute the installer.</p> <p>After the installer is done open up Publii, you should have a link in your desktop.</p> <p>Now you will get a screen prompting you to create a new site. Yes, you are very close. Can you feel it?</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*rHFadqXPukSOJJMiDY-yAw.png"><figcaption>Create website prompt on Publii</figcaption></figure><p>Type a name you want for your site. This is the name that will show up in the tab on your browser when you open it up. Now type your name in the author section, and selet any color and any logo, these will just be useful to recognize which site is which since you are able to handle multiple sites at once with this beautiful piece of software.</p> <p>After you are done press ‘create website’ and voilá you have generated your first site! But there are still some steps you need to take in order to put it online; in case you want to have a preview click on the option that says ‘preview your changes’ in the lower-right part of the Publii interface.</p> <h3>STEP IV: Connect Netlify and Publii</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*LC-U5znhu0odqz9JUOpzSw.jpeg"><figcaption>Perfect fit for each other</figcaption></figure><p>Now comes the time to join both worlds in perfect harmony.</p> <p>First, open up your Netlify account and you will be on the ‘Sites’ section of your profile. You will need to create one so then Publii can override the draft you created with the one you really want to upload. Don’t worry you won’t have to code anything just download a file and then drag and drop it.</p> <p>In <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/">THIS</a> page you will find a bunch of free themes that are all beautiful and fast, it’s the official site for Publii themes so you can’t go wrong with ay of them but be careful since there are about 3 or 4 of those that are paid and the rest are free. Let’s grab the one that looks like a technology blog; for speed’s sake this is the direct link to download it: <a href="https://cdn.getpublii.com/themes/technews_2.0.0.0.zip">TECH BLOG TEMPLATE</a>.</p> <p>Now unzip the file and drag and drop the folder in your browser inside the corresponding area.

This guide will fit your needs perfectly as I will show you how to easily build and deploy a site without any large quantities of money or anything like that. Get ready to build something this quarantine like this fierce lego lady is.</p> <p>This guide is meant for people with little knowledge on web dynamics to provide the steps needed to have a successful up-and-running site in no time. I will teach you where to get the template (because there is no need to reinvent the wheel), how to customize it, how the custom domains work, and finally how to upload your project to the web for the world to see. Take into account that there are a myriad of different alternatives different than the ones I’m going to show you here, each with its pros and cons, but this is just the starting point for you to begin your web journey and get the hype up.</p> <p>First of all, you might be wondering what do I mean by a “static site”. A static site is just a website whose content doesn’t change often and is mainly just up for informational purposes. An example of this would be something like a portfolio site that doesn’t get updated so often or a law firm’s site that just displays information on their services and some other general data, maybe a contact form.</p> <p>Now let’s got straight to the point:</p> <h3>STEP I: create a GitHub account.</h3> <p>GitHub is basically a social network for developers (like Behance is for creatives and artists to display their work). It is very easy to use and we will need this later on in order to host our source code.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/">Click here to go to the website.</a></p> <p>Github is a social network that uses the Git version control system. This means that basically you can save an article that you wrote here, then update the file because you forgot to add something but oh it turns out the way it was before was actually better! Don’t worry in this case thanks to the version control you will be able to go back to a previous version where everything was good, like time travel.</p> <p>Learning how to properly use Git will do wonders for you and save you a lot of headaches once you start getting deeper into programming but for now we’ll just use it to link the account to Netlify’s service.</p> <h3>STEP II: create a Netlify account.</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w27eVyuKccjhaX94B8l2FA.png"><figcaption>Netlify front page</figcaption></figure><p>Netlify is a modern platform designed to help you host your sites easier. This helps you save money in unnecessary hosting services if you just want to build a static site and not something that requires a massive backend development like a social network.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/">Click here to go to the website.</a></p> <p>Go to the link I just provided and click on ‘Get Started For Free’. Now you will be asked to log-in with a service of your choice, you will be given several options but guess which one you need to choose. That’s right, Github. After you selected it the system will prompt you to authorize Netlify -some backend magic happens here with OAuth security methods- and finally your account will be set.</p> <figure><img alt="Github Authentication screen" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G7J8sG45zUA9kEBUn3m-sg.png"></figure><p>Yes, it’s that simple, github will facilitate your life in many ways.</p> <h3>STEP III: Downoad Publii CMS</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c1nbe03bdy5bq9Txz_extg.png"><figcaption>Publii main screen</figcaption></figure><p>A Control Management System or better known as a CMS is a software that will allow you to build and edit web pages in this case with little to no technical knowledge. There are many other use cases and many different types of CMS tools for all sorts of thing but in this case we will keep our eyes on the web development side and use a CMS called ‘Publii’.</p> <p>Publii is an open source CMS developed by a guy named Bob Mitro that has been around in the web development world for a while now. This is not his first rodeo and it shows.</p> <p>Publii is designed to be used from your desktop so you have the advantage of being able to test your modifications offline, it will give you very fast loading speeds due to the lack of unnecessary bloating in the websites and it is a perfect start for your blogging journey.</p> <p>Now, you might be thinking: why would I use this instead of Wordpress? While Wordpress is the most widely used CMS in the market and it has a million features the reality is you need to spend more money, have greater technical knowledge, it is harder to handle and unless you want a very big website with lots of dynamic functions that require the use of some specific plugins it is not necessary. So let’s get started with the beautiful Publii!</p> <p><a href="https://getpublii.com/download/">First go to this site.</a></p> <p>Here you will be presented with some options for the type of download you want. Select the one that corresponds to your operating system and execute the installer.</p> <p>After the installer is done open up Publii, you should have a link in your desktop.</p> <p>Now you will get a screen prompting you to create a new site. Yes, you are very close. Can you feel it?</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*rHFadqXPukSOJJMiDY-yAw.png"><figcaption>Create website prompt on Publii</figcaption></figure><p>Type a name you want for your site. This is the name that will show up in the tab on your browser when you open it up. Now type your name in the author section, and selet any color and any logo, these will just be useful to recognize which site is which since you are able to handle multiple sites at once with this beautiful piece of software.</p> <p>After you are done press ‘create website’ and voilá you have generated your first site! But there are still some steps you need to take in order to put it online; in case you want to have a preview click on the option that says ‘preview your changes’ in the lower-right part of the Publii interface.</p> <h3>STEP IV: Connect Netlify and Publii</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*LC-U5znhu0odqz9JUOpzSw.jpeg"><figcaption>Perfect fit for each other</figcaption></figure><p>Now comes the time to join both worlds in perfect harmony.</p> <p>First, open up your Netlify account and you will be on the ‘Sites’ section of your profile. You will need to create one so then Publii can override the draft you created with the one you really want to upload. Don’t worry you won’t have to code anything just download a file and then drag and drop it.</p> <p>In <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/">THIS</a> page you will find a bunch of free themes that are all beautiful and fast, it’s the official site for Publii themes so you can’t go wrong with ay of them but be careful since there are about 3 or 4 of those that are paid and the rest are free.

I had just broken my arm and I was in the hospital with my parents waiting for my x-ray results, my mom pulls out this tiny thing — a Siemens Mobile phone — and says: “Check this out”, then she proceeds to write a text message and sends it to my dad’s phone. When he pulled out another phone and showed me the message I was shocked (then I spent all her texts playing with the phone).</p> <p>Society and technology have come a long way since then and now pretty much anything you can think of can be connected in some shape or form to this wonderful thing called the internet. In fact, the internet itself is a limitless connection of networks that talk to each other by some rules that were established a while back known as protocols.</p> <p>Along with many other impactful concepts like globalization in world politics came some other new ones like IoT (Internet of Things). But what exactly is this?</p> <p>The Internet of Things refers to the way technology has advanced up to the point where now even the clothes or shoes you wear can be connected to your mobile phone, and the phone connected to the internet so you can check out other people’s statistics and see if you ran your half-marathon faster than the average runner.</p> <p>Amazing, right?

I had just broken my arm and I was in the hospital with my parents waiting for my x-ray results, my mom pulls out this tiny thing — a Siemens Mobile phone — and says: “Check this out”, then she proceeds to write a text message and sends it to my dad’s phone. When he pulled out another phone and showed me the message I was shocked (then I spent all her texts playing with the phone).</p> <p>Society and technology have come a long way since then and now pretty much anything you can think of can be connected in some shape or form to this wonderful thing called the internet. In fact, the internet itself is a limitless connection of networks that talk to each other by some rules that were established a while back known as protocols.</p> <p>Along with many other impactful concepts like globalization in world politics came some other new ones like IoT (Internet of Things). But what exactly is this?</p> <p>The Internet of Things refers to the way technology has advanced up to the point where now even the clothes or shoes you wear can be connected to your mobile phone, and the phone connected to the internet so you can check out other people’s statistics and see if you ran your half-marathon faster than the average runner.</p> <p>Amazing, right? Now think about this so you can put it more into perspective and appreciate the advancements we have made a little more: over the last TWO years 90% of the data that currently exists (including all data from the past) was generated.

In this article we will focus on ML (machine learning) but we will also shed some light on it’s brother DL (deep learning) so you can tell the difference.</p> <p>Let’s get to it!</p> <h3>MACHINE LEARNING</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LdMJXjlgtRaCFr3f"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>At its core, machine learning simply refers to the sub-field of artificial intelligence used to analyze and interpret data in order to discover patterns or something else that the programmer desires and it can be used on pretty much any specific field you can think of. To illustrate things better think of the suggestions you get from Netflix for what you might want to watch next, TikTok’s system that will always throw content at you, or heart-rate monitors that analyze your data and give you suggestions such as “It seems you’re stressed. Breathe”. All these applications come from the implementation of different machine learning algorithms that use data to reach a “conclusion” that will result in some previously programmed action. Maybe it’s not what you expected seeing so many sci-fi references but the potential here is limitless and very powerful.</p> <p>Here, I will give you some of the core concepts that make ML and explain them briefly in bite sized portions.</p> <p>ML is all about applying math in cool ways so basically there are two main types of machine learning algorithms: <strong>supervised learning</strong> and <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>.</p> <h4>Supervised Learning</h4> <p>These algorithms get trained by having a labeled data set fed to it, it needs to be told what to receive and what the result will be for each thing that it receives. A labeled data set is a group of data that contains both the input and the expected output; an example could be a dog training: you say “hand” (the input) the dog now extends its paw towards you (the output).</p> <p>Such behavior of the supervised learning algorithm means that the more data it receives the better it will get in time. Designed to adjust itself by making predictions on the possible outcomes it is very useful to draw conclusions quickly and help people with their decision making processes like choosing which route to take home at rush hour, analyzing market prices by receiving certain attributes from the goods as input or calculating risk in a business environment where there is precedent that examples can be drawn from. As you may have noticed not all applications explicitly include numbers, how can this be? Well, there are also two main types of supervised learning algorithms to choose from: <strong>classification </strong>and<strong> regression.</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Classification:</strong> this model will take an input and the output can be either “binary” (1 or 0, yes or no, true or false) or have more than two types of results which would make it “multi”. The main takeaway here is that there is always a concrete result that doesn’t necessarily always refer to a number (value). For example: the input could be “Likes pineapple pizza?” and the output could be “Yes” or “No”; if the output is “Yes” then classify the subject as “Psychopath” and if the output is “No” classify the subject as “Normal”.</li> <li> <strong>Regression:</strong> this model will receive an input and always have a numeric value as the result, it’s goal is to predict as closely as possible the outcome of any given input by using quantifiable results. For example: you could use regression to calculate things related with the stock market, a highly numeric oriented field.</li> </ul> <p>Now, this is the case when you know what to expect. But what happens when you don’t? Here is when the other option comes into play:</p> <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4> <blockquote>“Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do.” — Steve Jobs</blockquote> <p>The previous quote has relevance in case of the unsupervised learning algorithm, it works with information that is not classified or labeled and so it must find and reach its own “conclusions”. Those conclusions could be patterns or statistics that point towards a hidden result or new discoveries that could be used to classify previously unclassified material.</p> <p>Basically, this algorithm will reach its own output and this output is not a concrete result. No one will tell it where to go or what to do, it will just look for the path it considers and give you a suggestion that may show you something you hadn’t noticed before. Much like Steve Jobs depicted in the quote above.</p> <p>Of course, this means there are a lot more complex calculations happening here than in the supervised algorithm. Due to its nature you can imagine that it has twice the amount of work. It needs to reach a suggested result and then feedback that output to itself in order to improve the execution and start getting more solid and precise suggestions. The two main algorithms that unsupervised machine learning uses are: <strong>clustering</strong> and <strong>dimensional</strong> <strong>reduction</strong>.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Clustering:</strong> the word ‘cluster’ means a group of things that share similarities, in this case the literal meaning of the word can shed some light on the application of this algorithm. What clustering does is it will analyze the data fed to it and perform some segmentation on it based on shared commonalities. It is not 100% accurate since there could be many factors to take into account in each case but it will definitely assist in reaching a goal where classification is done properly.</li> <li> <strong>Dimensional Reduction:</strong> is the method in which an unsupervised algorithm will analyze all the variables that are fed to it and will look for correlation and redundancy between them. Some times the amount of data to be analyzed is simply too large, in which case it is better and less time consuming to let an established algorithm decide which variables to into account instead of doing it by hand. The process is split in two parts that are very much self-explanatory: feature selection (this is where the data variables are analyzed) and feature extraction (this is where the data is compressed, made more manageable and time efficient).</li> </ul> <p>What I just described is a sneak peek of what is really the world of ML, this was the tip of the ice-berg but the main concepts so you can understand what it is are there. Within each algorithm there are more math equations and alternatives you can use to produce more accurate results. It is important to keep in mind that this subject is basically math applied to code in order to optimize processes so here is a little of what you should know going into it:</p> <h4>MATH</h4> <p>Mathematics will give you the thought analysis you need in order to know which type of algorithm, probability, statistic or result you want to get and most importantly HOW you are going to do it. While there are several libraries and tools available to simplify these processes there is always something that needs to be done the hard way and here are some of the math subjects that are mostly used in this field:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eUYIqyg9aomn55O-Q5XRVg.png"><figcaption>Picture taken from<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-of-machine-learning-894f046c568"> The Mathematics of Machine Learning</a> by <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/@WalePhenomenon?source=post_page-----894f046c568----------------------">Wale Akinfaderin</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Deep Learning (the pocket summary)</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GlL9hafF_DoSPdLT"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@averey?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Robina Weermeijer</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Think of the neurons in your brain: there are billions of them working together, connecting with each other to process your thoughts and memories.

"description": " <h3>Python Programming 101: Mutable and Immutable Objects</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YNSYQ70q0DZ95AFQhrU4rg.jpeg"></figure><p>There are a few things truer than true in this world: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, we are here for a finite amount of time and everything is an object in Python. You will find that in the last case the objects we are talking about are very abstract since you cannot grab them with your hands but once you understand the concept behind OOP (Object Oriented Programming) your horizon will expand. This time we are going to focus on a pair of characteristics that objects in Python may have: their mutable and immutable properties which will allow them to morph (or don’t) to what the user wants it to.</p> <p>First, lets’s take a look at a couple of helpful built-in functions Python has to offer.</p> <h4>ID()</h4> <p>This function will allow the user to see the identity of an object, in C it would be the address. One must only enter the object’s name inside the parentheses and the function will return the ID number.

You will find that in the last case the objects we are talking about are very abstract since you cannot grab them with your hands but once you understand the concept behind OOP (Object Oriented Programming) your horizon will expand. This time we are going to focus on a pair of characteristics that objects in Python may have: their mutable and immutable properties which will allow them to morph (or don’t) to what the user wants it to.</p> <p>First, lets’s take a look at a couple of helpful built-in functions Python has to offer.</p> <h4>ID()</h4> <p>This function will allow the user to see the identity of an object, in C it would be the address. One must only enter the object’s name inside the parentheses and the function will return the ID number. The number the function returns is unique but it may vary depending on the machine you execute it in; for example every citizen has a Social Security number, each one is different and each number will remain unique in a person’s lifetime. But what is this good for? In the event you want to identify if an object has retained its identity after the value has been altered this function can be your ally.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/133/1*UCwM5SSLL5_d3ss52OqCdA.png"></figure><h4>TYPE()</h4> <p>The ‘type’ function will allow the user to find out the type of variable that he is handling.

"description": " <figure><img alt="Objects &amp; Classes" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/791/1*0yPyQqkWpu5CO6V-pgT0xw.png"></figure><p>As you may already know, Python is a OOP oriented language, and while you can use it to program procedurally it is best used with the aforementioned programming paradigm. This means that it works best by organizing the data properly and creating classes so the code can be encapsulated and later reused for max efficiency and to avoid repeating unnecessary code blocks. All this can be achieved thanks to the objects and the classes you create along with their attributes and characteristics so let’s take a quick look as to what are some of the differences between them.</p> <h3><strong>Class and Class attributes</strong></h3> <p>A class goes hand in hand with the encapsulation principle of object oriented programming in which each object should be restricted to a certain field of action. A class is that field and the objects are the ones who play in it. Think of the class as a blueprint to build something, the most usual example is a house blueprint.</p> <p>The blueprint can contain the materials needed to build it, the distribution, the amount of rooms, and the color of the house. You could use one blueprint to build several houses and you could maybe paint them in different colors or change the amount of rooms but the core build of the house will come from that blueprint you have.</p> <p>This is what happens with classes. You can create a class to build something and then use it as many times as you like to build new things with it and those things can be the objects.</p> <p>When it comes to the attributes of a class in Python you will find that they refer to variable that belongs to the class and not to a particular object (like inside a method of the class). The attributes are defined outside of any object and before the constructor of the class (identifiable in Python by the __init__ method).</p> <p>They are shared by all the other objects inside the class like if they were a global variable.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/323/1*N_qNXX4OYn6S3xDbtygBhQ.png"></figure><p>The image above shows how we declare a class called ‘ClassDeclared’ that contains an attribute called ‘class_variable’ and is initialized to 0. Later we can find the constructor identified by the __init__ method.</p> <h3><strong>Objects and Object attributes</strong></h3> <p>There’s a lot of talk about objects but what exactly are they? This is an abstract concept since it doesn’t refer specifically to a physical object, but one could say that everything is an object in Python.</p> <p>An object is a collection of data with a particular objective, it can be a method (known as a function in procedural programming) or a variable.</p> <p>In Python, you can use classes to create objects of that type, think of it as if you were declaring a variable in C where you declare the variable type with ‘int’ and then you give it a name. Here, you can do something similar with classes.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/236/1*qbvFcDGm6HA2m-yIWef9dg.png"></figure><p>What happend here is that we just created an object called ‘object’ that will contain the atributes and methods contained in ‘ClassDeclared’. Our object will now inherit the class characteristics so if this was a house we would have just created a new house with all the details contained in the blueprint (the class).</p> <h3><strong>Difference Between Object and Class attributes:</strong></h3> <p>The main difference between both, other than the fact that objects and classes share different concepts, is that an object (or instance) attribute refers only to a variable that belongs to an object and is declared inside the __init__ method of your class, most commonly known in other languages as a constructor.</p> <p>On the other hand, a class attribute is a variable that must be declared outside of any other object (meaning methods in this case) so that it belongs to the class in general; it is almost like a mini global variable that can be initialized with a desired value or character to be used in any method (object) inside the class.</p> <p>The main advantage that these attributes can have is their ability to be used and reused whenever the programmer desires to do so, meaning less code must be rewritten and not all of it has to be imported. You could simply use certain attributes that work in any specific case for a task that you must develop or use certain methods for precise functionality.</p> <p>But not everything is rainbows and butterflies, a drawback in this case is that some times it can prove hard to keep track of every class and method you created so everything must be kept neatly organized and with proper notes. Also, but not anything significant, the concept can be harder to grasp due to its abstractness than a procedural type of coding.</p> <p>Object Oriented Programming can be a tricky concept to handle since it mostly consists of very abstract content, but in practice this is the most effective way to code specially in a team environment. Knowing the difference between instances and classes can help solidify the OOP paradigm in your mind so you can apply it easier in your real-life scenarios and the concepts discussed here are part of that core you must begin to learn.</p> <p>I hope you have a great day!</p> <p>S.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7b7c418eaf08" width="1" height="1"> "
